Excellent show.  I will watch for this event again for sure.  I was seated in the front row of the balcony, a great seat for the show.  However, walking past me to the center aisle seemed to be the only way others could access their seats.   The walkway is quite narrow also.   So I either had to keep getting up and down MANY times or keep bumping and annoying people as they tried to squeeze past.    Additional access routes to the seats in the middle would be good idea, perhaps an aisle across the top to the stairways, where the prospect of falling over the barrier to the loge below would not be an issue?",0.20796296296296296,

I highly recommend nearly all of their productions.  ","Excellent selection of an interesting movie, well produced.  Both sound quality and projection quality were good.  Movies like this are of high value to the community in that they are unlikely to appear in for profit cinemas that need to screen a show multiple times.   I would like to see more movies at Gesa.  It’s a good venue for “arty” or even foreign films.  However, those films require a first class marketing program which I don’t think Gesa has yet managed to accomplish.  Looking at the list of where we might hear of these films, there doesn’t seem to be any outlet targeting college students at Whitman or Whitman’s arts/drama/music departments.  There are documentaries  (such as “giants Rising”) that would be of interest to younger people if the marketing informs them effectively and in advance.  At the screening, there were movies previewed that I was unaware of (not in the Gesa brochure that was handed out).  There has been Quest classes on movies but I don’t think those potential audiences have been targeted.  
I would also be interested in seeing Gesa explore subscribing to NTLive programming.  That might be a partnership with the colleges/university offering a student discount price.  Please look into NTLive (National Theater of London productions that are filmed on the final night of performances that are at times better than the actual show — I saw a live performance and later the NTLive film of the live production: the camera angles gave much better reading of the actors than seeing it live.). I highly recommend nearly all of their productions.  ",0.2260774410774411,2024-02-01

If there is one thing that could take the Powerhouse from good to great, it would be to allow seating of patrons one hour before show time. After a certain age, adults do not enjoy being mashed together like a techno club mosh pit or a cattle truck.  If lighting and sound checks need to be done before the show, I would humbly suggest that the technicians come in a half hour earlier.  If the performer gets too claustrophobic waiting an hour before the show, then we might consider updating the Green Room.
I have observed patrons becoming angry,  waiting  half an hour for the  doors to open. lve also observed the opposite.  The inevitable outcome of opening the house only 30 min before show time, is that you've trained patrons to arrive at the last minute and then they are being seated after the show  has begun.  This is incredibly distracting for the audience and  perhaps for the performer as  well.

Would love to see them return to the Gesa Powerhouse Theatre.  More power!","The person who manned the spotlight did an exceptional job of keeping up with all the rapid changes.  The sound was clear and at an appropriate volume making it a pleasant experience and bringing out the characteristics of each instrument:  marimba (xylophone), standard flute, Native American flute (one of my favorites; so haunting), saxophone(s), piano, standard (stick) drumming, long djembe(?) hand drumming along with extras like juggling, tap dancing, beat boxing and singing.  Very well done! The members of Collision of Rhythm were two extremely talented guys whose desire is clearly to teach and create a community-based experience.  Their enthusiasm shined on us all, and the audience participation was absolutely essential to a successful performance.  ""We...we are made of music!""  To have a venue of inclusivity for younger and older generations alike is welcome.  The fast-moving tempo of the show kept it captivating.
