### 1. Operational Efficiency & Audience Growth
* **Assess Seasonality:** Identify seasonal peaks, slumps, and optimal scheduling windows by analyzing monthly attendance trends (excluding incomplete 2025 data).
* **Measure Retention:** Evaluate audience loyalty and long-term engagement by tracking the ratio of first-time vs. returning visitors over a two-year period.
* **Investigate Correlations:** Determine if there is a statistical relationship between high volumes of first-time visitors and total venue capacity utilization.

### 2. Event Performance Strategy
* **Benchmark Success:** Compare high-performing vs. low-performing events to isolate the specific characteristics (genre, timing, cast) that drive ticket sales.
* **Analyze Variables:** Determine the impact of event duration and average ticket pricing on total attendance numbers.
* **Identify Profit Drivers:** Distinguish which event types drive higher ticket revenue versus those that primarily drive donor engagement.

### 3. Financial Health Analysis
* **Attribute Revenue:** Isolate specific months and event types that generate the highest net financial gain for the organization.
* **Test Hypothesis:** Verify if higher attendance months correlate with increased donation revenue or if donations follow a different cycle.
* **Map Trends:** Chart monthly financial performance to pinpoint the theatre's strongest and weakest fiscal periods.

### 4. Marketing & Demographic Segmentation
* **Evaluate Channels:** Assess which marketing channels yield the highest conversion rate for *new* visitors.
* **Profile Demographics:** Segment the audience by age and income groups to understand the current attendee composition.
* **Map Preferences:** Correlate demographic segments with specific event types to help tailor future programming and marketing campaigns.

### 5. Customer Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
* **Extract Themes:** Implement **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to identify recurring positive and negative themes within unstructured survey feedback.
* **Score Sentiment:** Calculate sentiment scores per event and month to quantitatively measure audience satisfaction.
* **Correlate Data:** Compare qualitative sentiment scores against quantitative attendance metrics to determine if satisfaction levels directly impact footfall.

### 6. Predictive Modeling & Forecasting
* **Forecast Attendance:** Develop time-series forecasts to project monthly attendance figures for the upcoming season.
* **Identify Features:** Determine which features (e.g., day of week, duration, demographics) are the strongest predictors of high attendance.
* **Model Revenue:** Construct **predictive models** to estimate future donation levels based on attendance variables and first-time visitor ratios.
